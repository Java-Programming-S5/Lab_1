Class Questions 1

1.1 Beacause Computers are tools that can be programmed to
perform many functions

1.2 
The central processing unit (CPU)
Main memory
Secondary storage devices
Input devices
Output devices 

1.3
Arithmetic Logic Unit
Control Unit

1.4
Introctions given to the cpu during fetches arrive in a form of number that is encoded. In order to know which instruction go to which component, the cpu must decode the instruction.When decoded, the instruction is sent to the control unit, which then sends the proper signals to the arithmetic logic unit and other components to perform the instruction.

1.5 The location of where the variable is stored on the computer. When we assign a value to the variable, it is stored in this memory address.


1.6 
Main memory holds instructions and data when a program is executing
Secondary memory holds data and programs not currently in use and provides long-term storage.

1.7
A multitasking operating system is capable of running
multiple programs at once.

1.8 
A key word has a special purpose, and is defined as part of a programming language. A programmer-defined symbol is a word or name defined by the programmer.

1.9
Operators perform operations on one or more operands. Punctuation symbols mark the beginning or ending of a statement, or separates items in a list.

1.10
A line is a single line as it appears in the body of a program. A statement is a complete instruction that causes the computer to perform an action.

1.11
Because their contents may be changed.

1.12
The original value is overwritten.

1.13 A compiler is a program that translates source code into an executable form.

1.14 Syntax errors are mistakes that the programmer has made that violate the rules of the programming language. These errors must be corrected before the compiler can translate the source code.

1.15 The Java compiler translates Java source code into byte code, which is an intermediate language. The Java Virtual Machine executes the byte code instructions.
